       "     'content': \"Alright, so I have this problem where in triangle ABC, the medians BD and CE are perpendicular. BD is 8 units long, and CE is 12 units long. I need to find the area of triangle ABC. Hmm, okay. Let me think about what I know regarding medians and areas.\\n\\nFirst, I remember that a median of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So, in triangle ABC, BD is a median from B to the midpoint D of AC, and CE is a median from C to the midpoint E of AB.\\n\\nSince BD and CE are medians and they are perpendicular, that probably means the angle between BD and CE is 90 degrees. Also, their lengths are given: BD is 8 and CE is 12. I need to find the area of triangle ABC.\\n\\nI recall that the area of a triangle can be calculated if we know the lengths of two medians and the angle between them. Wait, is that correct? Or maybe it's a different formula. Let me think. I remember there's a formula for the area in terms of two medians and the angle between them. If two medians are m and n, and the angle between them is θ, then the area is (4/3) times the area of the triangle formed by the medians.\\n\\nSo, maybe I can find the area of the triangle formed by BD and CE and then adjust it somehow.\\n\\nWait, let me clarify. The triangle formed by the medians BD and CE would have sides of lengths 8 and 12, and the angle between them is 90 degrees because BD and CE are perpendicular. So, the area of this smaller triangle would be (1/2)*8*12 = 48.\\n\\nBut I think the formula for the area of the original triangle ABC in terms of the two medians and the angle between them is (4/3) times the area of the triangle formed by the medians. So, if the area formed by the medians is 48, then the area of ABC would be (4/3)*48 = 64.\\n\\nWait, is that accurate? Let me make sure. I might be confusing the formula. Let me recall, the area of the original triangle is (4/3) times the area of the triangle formed by its medians. So, yes, if the triangle formed by the medians has an area of 48, then ABC would have an area of (4/3)*48 = 64. That seems right.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it another way to verify. Let me try using coordinates. Sometimes coordinates can help visualize the problem.\\n\\nLet me place the triangle ABC in a coordinate system such that point B is at (0, 0), and since BD is a median, point D is the midpoint of AC. Similarly, point E is the midpoint of AB.\\n\\nWait, but since BD and CE are medians, and they are perpendicular, maybe I can assign coordinates such that the intersection point of the medians is at the origin.\\n\\nWait, but in a triangle, the medians intersect at the centroid, which divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. So, the centroid is located 2/3 of the way along each median from the vertex.\\n\\nSince BD and CE are medians and are perpendicular, the centroid G is where they intersect, and it divides each median into segments of 8*(2/3) and 8*(1/3), and similarly for CE.\\n\\nBut maybe assigning coordinates can help me find the coordinates of A, B, and C.\\n\\nLet me try that. Let me place the centroid G at (0,0). Then, since BD is a median of length 8, and it is divided by G into segments of 8*(2/3)=16/3 and 8*(1/3)=8/3. Similarly, CE is divided into 12*(2/3)=8 and 12*(1/3)=4.\\n\\nSince BD and CE are perpendicular, let me assign BD along the y-axis and CE along the x-axis for simplicity.\\n\\nSo, point G is the centroid, so it's located at (0,0). BD is a median of length 8, so from G, it goes 16/3 towards D, and 8/3 towards B.\\n\\nSimilarly, CE is a median of length 12, so from G, it goes 8 towards E, and 4 towards C.\\n\\nWait, but if BD is along the y-axis, then point D is (0, 16/3), and point B is (0, 8/3). Similarly, since CE is along the x-axis, point E is (8, 0), and point C is (-4, 0).\\n\\nWait, but hold on, is that correct? Let me think.\\n\\nIf BD is along the y-axis, then point D is the midpoint of AC, so if D is (0, 16/3), then point A and point C must be symmetric with respect to the y-axis.\\n\\nSimilarly, since CE is along the x-axis, point E is the midpoint of AB, so if E is (8,0), then point A and point B must be symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\\n\\nBut in this case, point B is (0, 8/3) and point E is (8,0). Hmm, but then point A must be such that E is the midpoint of AB. So, if E is (8, 0), and B is (0, 8/3), then the coordinates of A must be (16, -4/3), because the midpoint between A and B is ((16 + 0)/2, (-4/3 + 8/3)/2) = (8, (4/3)/2) = (8, 2/3). Wait, that's not (8,0). Hmm, I must have messed up.\\n\\nWait, maybe the direction is different. Let me define the coordinate system more clearly.\\n\\nLet me denote the centroid G as (0,0). Then, since BD is a median of length 8, and it is divided by G into BG : GD = 2:1. So, the distance from B to G is 8*(2/3) = 16/3, and from G to D is 8*(1/3) = 8/3. Similarly, for CE, which is 12 units, the centroid divides it into CG : GE = 2:1, so CG = 8, GE = 4.\\n\\nSince BD is perpendicular to CE, then BD is along one axis, say the y-axis, and CE is along the x-axis.\\n\\nSo, let me assign coordinates accordingly.\\n\\nLet me suppose that point G is at (0,0). Then, since BD is along the y-axis, point D is at (0, 8/3) because it's 8/3 units above G, and point B is at (0, -16/3) because it's 16/3 units below G.\\n\\nSimilarly, since CE is along the x-axis, point E is at (8, 0) because it's 8 units to the right of G, and point C is at (-4, 0) because it's 4 units to the left of G.\\n\\nWait, but if E is the midpoint of AB, and E is at (8,0), then if A is (x, y), then the midpoint between A and B is ((x + B_x)/2, (y + B_y)/2) = (8, 0). Similarly, if AB is from A to B, then E is the midpoint.\\n\\nBut B is at (0, -16/3), so midpoint between A and B is ((x + 0)/2, (y + (-16/3))/2) = (8, 0). Therefore, (x/2, (y - 16/3)/2) = (8, 0). So, x = 16, and (y - 16/3)/2 = 0 => y = 16/3.\\n\\nTherefore, point A is (16, 16/3).\\n\\nSimilarly, point C is (-4, 0), since E is (8,0) and E is the midpoint of AB and AC.\\n\\nWait, so point C is (-4, 0). Now, we can find point A as (16, 16/3), point B as (0, -16/3), and point C as (-4, 0).\\n\\nNow, let me confirm that the midpoints D and E are correct.\\n\\nPoint D is the midpoint of AC. So, coordinates of A are (16, 16/3), and coordinates of C are (-4, 0). So, midpoint D is ((16 + (-4))/2, (16/3 + 0)/2) = (12/2, (16/3)/2) = (6, 8/3). Wait, but earlier I thought D was (0, 8/3). That's a problem.\\n\\nWait, hold on, I must have made a mistake in my coordinate assignment.\\n\\nWait, if I set G at (0,0), and BD along the y-axis, then point D should be (0, 8/3) because it's 8/3 above G, and point B is (0, -16/3) because it's 16/3 below G.\\n\\nBut in my previous calculation, I got point D as (6, 8/3), which is different. Hmm, so that indicates an error in my coordinate system.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I messed up the direction of the medians. Maybe BD is not along the y-axis but in another orientation.\\n\\nWait, since BD is a median from B to AC, and CE is a median from C to AB, and they are perpendicular. So, perhaps I need a different approach.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe my initial coordinate system assignment was wrong because I assumed BD and CE were along the axes, but perhaps they are not.\\n\\nWait, another approach is to use vectors or coordinate geometry with a different setup.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the area given two medians and the angle between them. I think the formula is (4/3) times the area of the triangle formed by the medians.\\n\\nSince the medians BD and CE are perpendicular, the triangle formed by them is a right triangle with legs of lengths 8 and 12. So, the area of that triangle is (1/2)*8*12 = 48.\\n\\nTherefore, the area of the original triangle ABC is (4/3)*48 = 64.\\n\\nSo, that seems to confirm the first method. So, maybe 64 is the answer.\\n\\nBut just to be thorough, let me try to calculate the coordinates again.\\n\\nLet me place centroid G at (0,0). Then, since BD is a median of length 8, and it is divided by G into BG = 16/3 and GD = 8/3.\\n\\nSimilarly, CE is a median of length 12, divided by G into CG = 8 and GE = 4.\\n\\nSince BD is perpendicular to CE, let me assign BD along the y-axis and CE along the x-axis.\\n\\nTherefore, point G is at (0,0).\\n\\nSo, from G, moving along BD towards D is (0, 16/3), and towards B is (0, -16/3).\\n\\nSimilarly, moving along CE towards E is (8, 0), and towards C is (-4, 0).\\n\\nTherefore, point D is (0, 16/3), point B is (0, -16/3).\\n\\nPoint E is the midpoint of AB, so if E is (8, 0), and point B is (0, -16/3), let me find point A.\\n\\nMidpoint formula: E = ((A_x + B_x)/2, (A_y + B_y)/2) = (8, 0). So, ((A_x + 0)/2, (A_y + (-16/3))/2) = (8, 0). Therefore:\\n\\n(A_x)/2 = 8 => A_x = 16\\n\\n(A_y - 16/3)/2 = 0 => A_y - 16/3 = 0 => A_y = 16/3\\n\\nTherefore, point A is (16, 16/3)\\n\\nSimilarly, point C is the other endpoint of CE, which is (-4, 0).\\n\\nTherefore, points are:\\n\\nA: (16, 16/3)\\n\\nB: (0, -16/3)\\n\\nC: (-4, 0)\\n\\nNow, let me compute the area of triangle ABC using the coordinates.\\n\\nThe formula for the area given three points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) is:\\n\\nArea = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|\\n\\nPlugging in the points:\\n\\nx1 = 16, y1 = 16/3\\n\\nx2 = 0, y2 = -16/3\\n\\nx3 = -4, y3 = 0\\n\\nCompute each term:\\n\\nFirst term: x1(y2 - y3) = 16*(-16/3 - 0) = 16*(-16/3) = -256/3\\n\\nSecond term: x2(y3 - y1) = 0*(0 - 16/3) = 0\\n\\nThird term: x3(y1 - y2) = (-4)*(16/3 - (-16/3)) = (-4)*(32/3) = (-128)/3\\n\\nSum these terms:\\n\\n-256/3 + 0 + (-128)/3 = (-256 -128)/3 = (-384)/3 = -128\\n\\nTake the absolute value and divide by 2:\\n\\n| -128 | /2 = 128/2 = 64.\\n\\nSo, the area is 64. That's consistent with the earlier calculation.\\n\\nHence, I can be confident that the area of triangle ABC is 64.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe area of triangle \\\\(ABC\\\\) is \\\\boxed{64}.\\n</think>\\n\\nGiven triangle \\\\(ABC\\\\) with medians \\\\(BD\\\\) and \\\\(CE\\\\) that are perpendicular, where \\\\(BD = 8\\\\) and \\\\(CE = 12\\\\).

       "\"Okay, so George and Henry are racing in a pool, starting from opposite ends. After one and a half minutes, they pass each other in the center. I need to figure out how many minutes after starting they pass each other the second time. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, let me visualize the pool. They start from opposite ends, so if I imagine the pool as a straight line, George is at one end, and Henry is at the other end. They run towards each other, and after 1.5 minutes, they meet exactly in the middle. That tells me something about their speeds.\\n\\nLet me denote George's speed as \\\\( v_G \\\\) and Henry's speed as \\\\( v_H \\\\). Since they started at the same time and met at the center after 1.5 minutes, the distance each covered in that time must be equal because they met exactly halfway.\\n\\nAssuming the length of the pool is \\\\( L \\\\), each of them would have covered \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{2} \\\\) distance when they met. So, the distance George ran is \\\\( v_G \\\\times 1.5 \\\\) and the distance Henry ran is \\\\( v_H \\\\times 1.5 \\\\). Since both distances are equal to \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{2} \\\\), I can write:\\n\\n\\\\( v_G \\\\times 1.5 = \\\\frac{L}{2} \\\\)\\n\\\\( v_H \\\\times 1.5 = \\\\frac{L}{2} \\\\)\\n\\nFrom these equations, I can solve for their speeds:\\n\\n\\\\( v_G = \\\\frac{L}{2 \\\\times 1.5} = \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\) per minute\\n\\\\( v_H = \\\\frac{L}{2 \\\\times 1.5} = \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\) per minute\\n\\nWait a minute, both have the same speed? That seems interesting. So, George and Henry are running at the same speed! That might simplify things later on.\\n\\nNow, the question is about the second time they pass each other. They started from opposite ends, passed each other once at the center, and now I need to find when they pass each other again.\\n\\nSince they are running towards each other the first time, they meet at the center. After that, they have to keep going to the ends, turn around instantly, and then run back towards each other.\\n\\nI need to figure out how long it takes from the start until they meet again. Hmm, so after the first meeting, they continue to the opposite ends, turn around, and then start running back towards each other. The second meeting would occur after some time from the first meeting.\\n\\nLet me think about their paths. After the first meeting, George still has \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{2} \\\\) to go to reach Henry's starting point, and Henry also has \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{2} \\\\) to go to reach George's starting point.\\n\\nSo, they each take the same time to reach the opposite end, right? Since they have the same speed, it'll take them the same amount of time to cover \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{2} \\\\) at speed \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\) per minute. Let me calculate that time.\\n\\nTime = Distance / Speed\\nTime taken to reach the opposite end from the center is \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\frac{L}{2}}{\\\\frac{L}{3}} = \\\\frac{L}{2} \\\\times \\\\frac{3}{L} = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\) minutes. So, it takes 1.5 minutes for each of them to reach the opposite end after meeting.\\n\\nSo, from the first meeting at 1.5 minutes, they each take 1.5 minutes to reach the opposite end. That means they arrive at the opposite ends at \\\\( 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 \\\\) minutes.\\n\\nAt 3 minutes, they both are at the opposite ends. Now, they turn around instantly and start running back towards each other. So, now they are moving towards each other again. I need to find when they meet again.\\n\\nI think the key here is to realize that the time between consecutive meetings is the same. Since they met the first time at 1.5 minutes, and then another time 3 minutes later, maybe the time between each meeting is 1.5 minutes? Wait, that might not be the case.\\n\\nWait, no. Let me consider the total distance covered when they meet for the second time. Each time they meet, together they have covered the entire length of the pool twice. Wait, let me think.\\n\\nActually, when two people start from opposite ends and move towards each other, they meet after together covering the length of the pool. Then, after that, they continue to the ends, turn around, and now start moving towards each other again, so they will meet again after together covering the length of the pool again.\\n\\nSo, the first meeting: together covering \\\\( L \\\\).\\nThe second meeting: together covering \\\\( 2L \\\\).\\n\\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again.\\n\\nNo, actually, the first meeting occurs when they have covered \\\\( L \\\\) together. After that, to meet again, they need to cover another \\\\( 2L \\\\) because they have to go to the ends and come back. Hmm, maybe not.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I should model the entire journey.\\n\\nLet me denote \\\\( t \\\\) as the total time from the start until they meet again. The first meeting is at \\\\( t_1 = 1.5 \\\\) minutes.\\n\\nAfter that, each of them takes 1.5 minutes to reach the opposite end, so they reach the ends at \\\\( t_2 = 3 \\\\) minutes.\\n\\nAt \\\\( t_2 = 3 \\\\) minutes, they turn around and start moving towards each other again. Now, they have to cover the length of the pool again to meet each other.\\n\\nWait, so the distance between them at \\\\( t_2 \\\\) is when they are at opposite ends. So, the distance between them is \\\\( L \\\\). They are now moving towards each other again, each with speed \\\\( v_G \\\\) and \\\\( v_H \\\\).\\n\\nSince they are moving towards each other, their relative speed is \\\\( v_G + v_H \\\\). The time it takes to meet again is \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{v_G + v_H} \\\\).\\n\\nBut since they have the same speed, \\\\( v_G = v_H = \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\) per minute, so their relative speed is \\\\( \\\\frac{2L}{3} \\\\) per minute.\\n\\nTherefore, the time taken to meet again after \\\\( t_2 = 3 \\\\) minutes is \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{\\\\frac{2L}{3}} = \\\\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\\\) minutes.\\n\\nSo, the second meeting occurs at \\\\( t = 3 + 1.5 = 4.5 \\\\) minutes.\\n\\nWait, so that's 4.5 minutes after starting, they meet again.\\n\\nBut let me double-check because sometimes intuition can be misleading.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can think about the total distance each has covered when they meet the second time.\\n\\nGeorge started at one end, ran for 4.5 minutes, and Henry started at the other end.\\n\\nGiven that their speeds are equal, \\\\( v_G = v_H = \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\) per minute.\\n\\nSo, the distance George ran is \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\times 4.5 = \\\\frac{4.5L}{3} = 1.5L \\\\).\\n\\nSimilarly, Henry ran \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\times 4.5 = 1.5L \\\\).\\n\\nSince the pool is length \\\\( L \\\\), 1.5L means they've covered more than the pool's length. That makes sense because they went to the ends, turned around, and came back.\\n\\nSo, 1.5L is a little over the pool length. So, the second meeting is when both have covered 1.5L. That seems consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, since each time they meet, they together cover \\\\( 2L \\\\). The first meeting after starting is \\\\( L \\\\), and the second meeting is \\\\( 3L \\\\) together. Wait, but that might not be the case.\\n\\nWait, no, after the first meeting, they continue to the opposite ends, which is another \\\\( L \\\\) each, then turn around and come back towards each other, which is another \\\\( L \\\\). So, in total, they have covered \\\\( L \\\\) (first meeting) + \\\\( 2L \\\\) (to opposite ends and back) = \\\\( 3L \\\\) together.\\n\\nBut in our earlier calculation, the second meeting happens at 4.5 minutes, where together they covered \\\\( 1.5L + 1.5L = 3L \\\\). So, that's consistent.\\n\\nWait, but according to this, the total distance covered together when they meet the second time is \\\\( 3L \\\\). So, the second meeting occurs when together they have covered \\\\( 3L \\\\). So, how much time does that take?\\n\\nSince their combined speed is \\\\( 2v_G \\\\) (since \\\\( v_G = v_H \\\\)), then time taken to cover \\\\( 3L \\\\) together is \\\\( \\\\frac{3L}{2v_G} \\\\).\\n\\nBut we know \\\\( v_G = \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\) per minute, so substituting that:\\n\\nTime = \\\\( \\\\frac{3L}{2 \\\\times \\\\frac{L}{3}} = \\\\frac{3L}{\\\\frac{2L}{3}} = \\\\frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \\\\) minutes.\\n\\nAlright, that matches the previous result.\\n\\nTherefore, the time when they pass each other the second time is 4.5 minutes after starting.\\n\\nBut let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\\n\\nAnother method: instead of tracking their positions, think of the entire pool as a loop with length \\\\( L \\\\).\\n\\nWhen two people run towards each other, their first meeting is after covering \\\\( L \\\\) together. Their second meeting is after another \\\\( 2L \\\\) together, meaning \\\\( 3L \\\\) together.\\n\\nSince their combined speed is \\\\( 2v \\\\) (since they have equal speed \\\\( v \\\\)), the time taken is \\\\( \\\\frac{3L}{2v} \\\\).\\n\\nWe can find \\\\( v \\\\) from the first meeting.\\n\\nIn the first meeting, each has covered \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{2} \\\\) together, so \\\\( v \\\\times t_1 + v \\\\times t_1 = L \\\\), where \\\\( t_1 = 1.5 \\\\) minutes.\\n\\nSo, \\\\( 2v \\\\times 1.5 = L \\\\), which gives \\\\( v = \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\) per minute.\\n\\nTherefore, the time for the second meeting is \\\\( \\\\frac{3L}{2 \\\\times \\\\frac{L}{3}} = \\\\frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \\\\) minutes.\\n\\nSo, that's consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, think about the number of laps each has completed.\\n\\nGeorge's speed is \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\) per minute, so in 4.5 minutes, he runs \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\times 4.5 = 1.5L \\\\). Similarly, Henry does the same.\\n\\nThus, each has completed 1.5 laps. Since they started from opposite ends, each lap is the length of the pool.\\n\\nSo, 1.5 laps from opposite ends: starting from one end, after 0.5 laps, they meet at the center. After 1.5 laps, they meet again at the center.\\n\\nWait, no, that can't be. Wait, if you have a pool, each lap is from one end to the other.\\n\\nIf George starts at one end and runs 1.5 laps, he goes from one end to the other (1 lap) and then half a lap back towards the starting point. Similarly, Henry starts at the other end and runs 1.5 laps, going to the starting end and then half a lap back.\\n\\nSo, where do they meet?\\n\\nAt 1.5 laps, George is halfway back towards the starting end, and Henry is halfway back towards the starting end. So, they meet at the starting end? Wait, no.\\n\\nWait, actually, in a 1D pool, it's a straight line from one end to the other. So, starting point of George is A, Henry is at B. After 1.5 laps, George has gone from A to B to halfway back to A, and Henry has gone from B to A to halfway back to B.\\n\\nSo, they both are at the midpoint of the pool, which is the center. So, yes, they meet at the center again.\\n\\nWait, that's actually the first meeting. So, maybe that method isn't helpful here.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the entire pool as a coordinate system, with George starting at position 0, and Henry starting at position L. The pool is 0 to L.\\n\\nTheir positions as functions of time can be given by:\\n\\nGeorge's position: \\\\( x_G(t) = v_G t \\\\mod L \\\\)\\nHenry's position: \\\\( x_H(t) = L - v_H t \\\\mod L \\\\)\\n\\nThey meet when \\\\( x_G(t) = x_H(t) \\\\).\\n\\nGiven that they meet first at t = 1.5 minutes, so:\\n\\n\\\\( v_G \\\\times 1.5 = L - v_H \\\\times 1.5 \\\\)\\n\\nBut since they started at opposite ends, and have same speed, \\\\( v_G = v_H \\\\).\\n\\nSo, \\\\( v_G \\\\times 1.5 = L - v_G \\\\times 1.5 \\\\)\\n\\\\( 2 \\\\times 1.5 v_G = L \\\\)\\n\\\\( v_G = \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\) per minute.\\n\\nSo, same as before.\\n\\nNow, to find the second meeting time, set \\\\( x_G(t) = x_H(t) \\\\).\\n\\n\\\\( v_G t = L - v_H t \\\\)\\nBut since \\\\( v_G = v_H \\\\), this becomes:\\n\\\\( v_G t = L - v_G t \\\\)\\n\\\\( 2 v_G t = L \\\\)\\n\\\\( t = \\\\frac{L}{2 v_G} = \\\\frac{L}{2 \\\\times \\\\frac{L}{3}} = \\\\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\\\) minutes.\\n\\nWait, that gives t = 1.5 minutes, which is the same as the first meeting time. That can't be right because they passed each other again after some time.\\n\\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation.\\n\\nWait, their positions:\\n\\n\\\\( x_G(t) = v_G t \\\\mod L \\\\)\\n\\\\( x_H(t) = L - v_H t \\\\mod L \\\\)\\n\\nThey meet when \\\\( x_G(t) = x_H(t) \\\\).\\n\\nBut since they are moving towards each other, perhaps the correct equation is when \\\\( x_G(t) = x_H(t) \\\\).\\n\\nBut in a 1D pool, maybe it's better to model it as a circular track, but since it's a straight pool, it's more like a linear track with periodic boundary conditions.\\n\\nWait, perhaps not. Maybe I need to think about it differently.\\n\\nAlternatively, consider that when they meet the second time, the total distance covered by both is \\\\( 3L \\\\), as previously determined.\\n\\nSince they started at opposite ends, moving towards each other, then to the ends, then back towards each other, so they cover \\\\( L \\\\) for the first meeting, \\\\( 2L \\\\) for the second meeting.\\n\\nWait, no, that's the same as the first approach.\\n\\nWait, I think the confusion arises because in the second meeting, they have to cover another \\\\( 2L \\\\), but in reality, it's \\\\( 3L \\\\) together.\\n\\nWait, hold on, no. The first meeting is at \\\\( L \\\\) together, and the second would be at \\\\( 3L \\\\) together.\\n\\nSo, 4.5 minutes is the correct time.\\n\\nAlternatively, let me think about their positions at 4.5 minutes.\\n\\nGeorge has run \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\times 4.5 = 1.5L \\\\). So, starting from one end, going around the pool twice, ending up at the same starting point.\\n\\nSimilarly, Henry has run \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\times 4.5 = 1.5L \\\\), so starting from the other end, going around the pool twice, ending up at the same starting point.\\n\\nTherefore, they both meet at the starting end.\\n\\nWait, but that can't be right because they started at opposite ends, met in the center, then both went to the ends, turned around, and met again at the center? That seems conflicting.\\n\\nWait, no, if George is at the center after 4.5 minutes, and same with Henry, they meet at the center again.\\n\\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, they meet at the center again at 4.5 minutes. So, that's consistent with the first meeting.\\n\\nWait, but wait, in that case, it's the same as the first meeting. So, why did we get 4.5 minutes?\\n\\nWait, no. Wait, maybe I have a misunderstanding.\\n\\nWait, when they start at opposite ends, their first meeting is at the center. Then, as they continue moving, they reach the ends, turn around, and start moving back towards each other. Then, they meet again at the center.\\n\\nSo, the first meeting is at 1.5 minutes, second meeting is at 4.5 minutes, third meeting at 7.5 minutes, etc.\\n\\nSo, actually, the second meeting is at 4.5 minutes.\\n\\nBut in my coordinate system earlier, both George and Henry end up at the starting end after 4.5 minutes, but that's actually the same as the first meeting point.\\n\\nWait, that seems contradictory.\\n\\nWait, no, maybe because they started at opposite ends, so when George reaches the end, he turns around, and Henry also reaches the end and turns around. So, after 1.5 minutes, they meet at the center.\\n\\nThen, each takes 1.5 minutes to reach the ends, so they reach the ends at 3 minutes.\\n\\nAt 3 minutes, both are at the ends. Then, they start moving back towards each other.\\n\\nSo, from 3 minutes onwards, they are moving towards each other again, starting from opposite ends.\\n\\nSo, the distance between them is L, and their combined speed is \\\\( 2v_G = 2 \\\\times \\\\frac{L}{3} = \\\\frac{2L}{3} \\\\) per minute.\\n\\nTherefore, the time to meet again is \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{\\\\frac{2L}{3}} = 1.5 \\\\) minutes.\\n\\nSo, the second meeting occurs at 3 + 1.5 = 4.5 minutes.\\n\\nSo, that's consistent with the earlier result.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is 4.5 minutes, which is \\\\( \\\\boxed{4.5} \\\\) minutes.\\n\\nWait, but in the first approach, when I considered that together they cover 3L, which is 4.5 minutes, that also gives 4.5 minutes.\\n\\nSo, both methods lead to the same answer, so I think that's correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is 4.5 minutes.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{4.5}\\n</think>\\n\\nGeorge and Henry start a race from opposite ends of the pool. After 1.5 minutes, they pass each other in the center of the pool. We need to determine how many minutes after starting they pass each other the second time.\\n\\n1. **Determine their speeds:**\\n   - Let \\\\( v_G \\\\) be George's speed and \\\\( v_H \\\\) be Henry's speed.\\n   - They start from opposite ends and meet at the center after 1.5 minutes.\\n   - Each has covered half the length of the pool, \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{2} \\\\), in 1.5 minutes.\\n   - Therefore, \\\\( v_G = \\\\frac{L/2}{1.5} = \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\) per minute.\\n   - Similarly, \\\\( v_H = \\\\frac{L}{3} \\\\) per minute.\\n\\n2. **Calculate the time for the second meeting:**\\n   - After meeting at the center, they continue to the opposite ends, each taking 1.5 minutes to reach the end.\\n   - They then turn around and start running back towards each other.\\n   - The time taken to meet again after turning around is the time for them to cover the length of the pool together.\\n   - Their combined speed is \\\\( v_G + v_H = \\\\frac{L}{3} + \\\\frac{L}{3} = \\\\frac{2L}{3} \\\\) per minute.\\n   - The time to meet again is \\\\( \\\\frac{L}{\\\\frac{2L}{3}} = \\\\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \\\\) minutes.\\n   - Therefore, the total time from the start until they meet the second time is \\\\( 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 \\\\) minutes after the first meeting, which is \\\\( 3 + 1.5 = 4.5 \\\\) minutes.\\n\\nThus, the time when they pass each other the second time is \\\\(\\\\boxed{4.5}\\\\) minutes.\""

       "     'content': \"Okay, so I need to find the smallest integer value of \\\\( k \\\\) such that the equation \\\\( 2x(kx - 4) - x^2 + 6 = 0 \\\\) has no real roots. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, I should probably simplify the equation to see if I can express it in a standard quadratic form. Quadratic equations are easier to analyze for the nature of their roots, so that's a good starting point. Let me expand the terms step by step.\\n\\nStarting with the original equation:\\n\\\\[ 2x(kx - 4) - x^2 + 6 = 0 \\\\]\\n\\nLet me distribute the \\\\( 2x \\\\) across the terms inside the parentheses:\\n\\\\[ 2x \\\\cdot kx - 2x \\\\cdot 4 - x^2 + 6 = 0 \\\\]\\n\\nCalculating each multiplication:\\n- \\\\( 2x \\\\cdot kx = 2k x^2 \\\\)\\n- \\\\( -2x \\\\cdot 4 = -8x \\\\)\\n\\nSo, substituting back into the equation:\\n\\\\[ 2k x^2 - 8x - x^2 + 6 = 0 \\\\]\\n\\nNow, I need to combine like terms. The \\\\( x^2 \\\\) terms are \\\\( 2k x^2 \\\\) and \\\\( -x^2 \\\\), so combining those:\\n\\\\[ (2k - 1) x^2 - 8x + 6 = 0 \\\\]\\n\\nOkay, so now the equation is a quadratic in the form:\\n\\\\[ a x^2 + b x + c = 0 \\\\]\\nwhere:\\n- \\\\( a = 2k - 1 \\\\)\\n- \\\\( b = -8 \\\\)\\n- \\\\( c = 6 \\\\)\\n\\nNow, for a quadratic equation to have no real roots, the discriminant must be negative. Remember, the discriminant \\\\( D \\\\) is given by:\\n\\\\[ D = b^2 - 4ac \\\\]\\n\\nIf \\\\( D < 0 \\\\), the equation has no real roots. So, let's compute the discriminant using the values of \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) we have:\\n\\nSubstituting:\\n\\\\[ D = (-8)^2 - 4 \\\\cdot (2k - 1) \\\\cdot 6 \\\\]\\n\\nCalculating each part:\\n- \\\\( (-8)^2 = 64 \\\\)\\n- \\\\( 4 \\\\cdot (2k - 1) \\\\cdot 6 = 4 \\\\cdot 6 \\\\cdot (2k - 1) = 24(2k - 1) \\\\)\\n\\nSo, the discriminant becomes:\\n\\\\[ D = 64 - 24(2k - 1) \\\\]\\n\\nLet me simplify that:\\nFirst, distribute the 24:\\n\\\\[ D = 64 - 48k + 24 \\\\]\\n\\nCombine like terms:\\n\\\\[ D = (64 + 24) - 48k \\\\]\\n\\\\[ D = 88 - 48k \\\\]\\n\\nFor the equation to have no real roots, the discriminant must be less than zero:\\n\\\\[ 88 - 48k < 0 \\\\]\\n\\nLet me solve this inequality for \\\\( k \\\\):\\n\\\\[ 88 - 48k < 0 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 88 < 48k \\\\]\\n\\\\[ \\\\frac{88}{48} < k \\\\]\\nSimplify \\\\( \\\\frac{88}{48} \\\\):\\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8:\\n\\\\[ \\\\frac{11}{6} < k \\\\]\\n\\nSo, \\\\( k \\\\) must be greater than \\\\( \\\\frac{11}{6} \\\\). Calculating \\\\( \\\\frac{11}{6} \\\\) gives approximately:\\n\\\\[ \\\\frac{11}{6} \\\\approx 1.8333 \\\\]\\n\\nSince \\\\( k \\\\) must be an integer, the smallest integer greater than 1.8333 is \\\\( 2 \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( k = 2 \\\\) is the smallest integer value such that the original equation has no real roots.\\n\\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\\n\\nStarting from the top:\\nOriginal equation: \\\\( 2x(kx - 4) - x^2 + 6 = 0 \\\\)\\n\\nExpanding:\\n\\\\( 2k x^2 - 8x - x^2 + 6 = 0 \\\\)\\nCombining like terms:\\n\\\\( (2k - 1)x^2 - 8x + 6 = 0 \\\\)\\n\\nDiscriminant:\\n\\\\( D = (-8)^2 - 4(2k -1)(6) = 64 - 24(2k -1) \\\\)\\nWhich simplifies to:\\n\\\\( 64 - 48k + 24 = 88 - 48k \\\\)\\n\\nSet discriminant < 0:\\n\\\\( 88 - 48k < 0 \\\\)\\n\\\\( 88 < 48k \\\\)\\n\\\\( k > \\\\frac{88}{48} = \\\\frac{11}{6} \\\\approx 1.8333 \\\\)\\n\\nSo, yes, \\\\( k \\\\) must be greater than approximately 1.8333, so the smallest integer is 2.\\n\\nBut hold on a second, let me test \\\\( k = 2 \\\\) in the original equation to see if it indeed results in no real roots.\\n\\nSubstituting \\\\( k = 2 \\\\) into the equation:\\n\\\\[ 2x(2x - 4) - x^2 + 6 = 0 \\\\]\\nExpanding:\\n\\\\[ 4x^2 - 8x - x^2 + 6 = 0 \\\\]\\nCombining like terms:\\n\\\\[ 3x^2 - 8x + 6 = 0 \\\\]\\n\\nCompute the discriminant for this quadratic:\\n\\\\[ D = (-8)^2 - 4 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot 6 = 64 - 72 = -8 \\\\]\\n\\nSince \\\\( D = -8 < 0 \\\\), the quadratic indeed has no real roots when \\\\( k = 2 \\\\). So, \\\\( k = 2 \\\\) is correct.\\n\\nBut just to make sure, let me test \\\\( k = 1 \\\\) to see if it does have real roots.\\n\\nSubstituting \\\\( k = 1 \\\\):\\n\\\\[ 2x(1x - 4) - x^2 + 6 = 0 \\\\]\\nExpanding:\\n\\\\[ 2x^2 - 8x - x^2 + 6 = 0 \\\\]\\nCombining like terms:\\n\\\\[ x^2 - 8x + 6 = 0 \\\\]\\n\\nCompute the discriminant:\\n\\\\[ D = (-8)^2 - 4 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\cdot 6 = 64 - 24 = 40 \\\\]\\nSince \\\\( D = 40 > 0 \\\\), the equation has two real roots. So, \\\\( k = 1 \\\\) does result in real roots, which means our earlier conclusion that \\\\( k > 1.8333 \\\\) is correct.\\n\\nTherefore, the smallest integer \\\\( k \\\\) is indeed 2.\\n\\nWait, another thought: Did I correctly compute the discriminant when \\\\( k = 2 \\\\)?\\n\\nYes, because substituting \\\\( k = 2 \\\\) into the equation, we get a quadratic with discriminant \\\\( 88 - 48*2 = 88 - 96 = -8 \\\\), which is negative. So, that's correct.\\n\\nI think I covered all the bases here. So, I'm confident that the smallest integer value of \\\\( k \\\\) is 2.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe smallest integral value of \\\\( k \\\\) is \\\\boxed{2}.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo find the smallest integral value of \\\\( k \\\\) such that the equation \\\\( 2x(kx - 4) - x^2 + 6 = 0 \\\\) has no real roots, we start by simplifying the equation into a standard quadratic form.\\n\\nFirst, we expand and simplify the given equation:\\n\\\\[\\n2x(kx - 4) - x^2 + 6 = 0\\n\\\\]\\nExpanding the terms:\\n\\\\[\\n2k x^2 - 8x - x^2 + 6 = 0\\n\\\\]\\nCombining like terms:\\n\\\\[\\n(2k - 1)x^2 - 8x + 6 = 0\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form \\\\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\\\) where:\\n- \\\\( a = 2k - 1 \\\\)\\n- \\\\( b = -8 \\\\)\\n- \\\\( c = 6 \\\\)\\n\\nFor the quadratic equation to have no real roots, the discriminant must be negative. The discriminant \\\\( D \\\\) is given by:\\n\\\\[\\nD = b^2 - 4ac\\n\\\\]\\nSubstituting the values of \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\):\\n\\\\[\\nD = (-8)^2 - 4(2k - 1) \\\\cdot 6\\n\\\\]\\nCalculating each part:\\n\\\\[\\nD = 64 - 24(2k - 1)\\n\\\\]\\nSimplifying:\\n\\\\[\\nD = 64 - 48k + 24 = 88 - 48k\\n\\\\]\\n\\nFor the equation to have no real roots, the discriminant must be less than zero:\\n\\\\[\\n88 - 48k < 0\\n\\\\]\\nSolving this inequality:\\n\\\\[\\n88 < 48k\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{88}{48} < k\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{11}{6} < k\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSince \\\\( \\\\frac{11}{6} \\\\approx 1.8333 \\\\), the smallest integer value of \\\\( k \\\\) is 2. We verify this by substituting \\\\( k = 2 \\\\) back into the quadratic equation and checking the discriminant, which is indeed negative.\\n\\nThus, the smallest integral value of \\\\( k \\\\) is \\\\boxed{2}.\",\n",
